🚀 NEXT STEPS:
Open 4 terminal windows and run these commands:

Terminal 1 - Backend:
  cd /home/cavin/projects/Jeseci-Interactive-Learning-Platform
  ./start_backend.sh

Terminal 2 - Celery Worker:
  cd /home/cavin/projects/Jeseci-Interactive-Learning-Platform
  ./start_celery.sh

Terminal 3 - Frontend:
  cd /home/cavin/projects/Jeseci-Interactive-Learning-Platform
  ./start_frontend.sh

🔗 Access Points:
• Frontend: http://localhost:3000
• Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/
• Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/

🔍 If you encounter any issues:
• Check that Redis is running: sudo systemctl status redis
• Ensure virtual environment is activated
• JaC walkers have fallback execution if compilation fails
• React development server handles TypeScript warnings

🎉 Your Multi-Agent Learning Platform is ready with all fixes applied! 🚀
