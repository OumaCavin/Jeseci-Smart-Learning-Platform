🔗 Access Points:
• Frontend: http://localhost:3000
• Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/
• Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/

🔍 If you encounter any issues:
• Check that Redis is running: sudo systemctl status redis
• Ensure virtual environment is activated
• JaC walkers have fallback execution if compilation fails
• React development server handles TypeScript warnings
